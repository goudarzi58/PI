Can you please build a script to query the dynamo DB table and dump into CSV ? Every day we should be able to just run the script, generate the csv .. Metrics should cover 
Number of files processed
Number of containers used
Number of Redacted Vs Sovereign files 
Time taken per file 
Number of pages for redacted files
Avg processing time
If #5 is heavy lift , ignore it.. just thinking what would make sense to have in a status report
 
This needs to go out as daily status report...
