ðŸ”§ Development Team Summary
Team Members Referenced: Abbas, Monica, Anil, Abhijit, Vijay

 1. Go-Live Readiness (Target: June 30)
Team is tracking toward a June 30 Go-Live.

Daily 9:30 AM sync scheduled to align across teams; Abbas, Monica, and Anil are expected to join.

Final review with Abhijit and Vijay to ensure all items are on track.

Any new requirements post-June 30 will be documented separately and not included in current scope.

ðŸ“‚ 2. S3 Bucket Structure & File Routing
Only sovereign documents will go to the ready-for-review bucket under /sovereign/.

All other redacted files will go to the redacted bucket.

Folder-level separation will be used instead of additional buckets for maintainability.

Future-proofing by optionally adding /pre-1990/ or other folders inside ready-for-review.

3. DynamoDB Integration
Dev team will start writing redaction metadata into DynamoDB.

Required schema to include:

file_name

redaction_status

s3_location

document_type (e.g., sovereign, standard)

processed_at, redacted_at

Appian will not query DynamoDB directly (at this point); API can be considered later.

4. JSON Manifest File (Alternate Audit Trail)
In addition to DynamoDB, team will generate JSON files per batch/day:

Lists all processed files and their status

Stored in /status-manifests/ S3 path

Reuses pattern from Comprehend solution for consistency

Appian can fetch JSON files instead of relying on API calls

5. Access to 4.5M Documents
Access is still pending to the 4.5 million documents Abhi shared

This is a critical blocker for initiating runs in staging or dev environments

Team needs to confirm:

S3 bucket permissions

Copy/sync paths for dev/test/staging

 6. Dev/Test Environment Folder Pickup Logic
Dev team to confirm with SOS whether itâ€™s acceptable to:

Reuse existing sample files

Validate pickup/drop-off flow using folder simulation

Final confirmation expected during next SOS touchpoint

7. New Requirement Handling (CYA Strategy)
Any new asks must be:

Formally documented (e.g., by Avi or Victoria)

Reviewed for effort/timeline

Logged as out-of-scope for June 30

Abhi to send skeleton of new request doc for traceability

8. Communication Logistics
Abbas, Monica, and Anil will continue to work via:

Smaller group chat with Uday and Cyn

Broader team chat for cross-functional visibility when needed
