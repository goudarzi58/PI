In Abbas's absence, he proactively initiated work on the configuration setup by externalizing all previously hard-coded variables into a config.json file. This included parameters such as the prompt, SDA values, S3 bucket locations, and other necessary runtime variables.

Current Status:

This morning, Abbas and I synced to review the progress.

A dummy Python script was created to validate the ability to read all variables from the config.json file.

Minor adjustments were made during our working session, but the script now successfully reads all required configuration values.

✅ Outcome:
The configuration setup—externalizing variables and validating the JSON structure—is complete.

Messaging Queue & Lambda Function Access – Status Update
Messaging Queue (SOS Queue):

There is still uncertainty around the use of the SOS queue:

Should we use the existing queue?

Or should we provision a new queue?

Action Item: Connect with Bharat to clarify the intended design and integration pattern for messaging queues.

Lambda Function Access:

Initial Blocker: Neither team member had access earlier, which was required for testing message consumption and triggering logic.

Update: Abbas now has access to the Lambda function and has started reviewing it.

Next Step: Monica to follow up with Jamal to gain Lambda access as well, in case the issue persists on her end.

Open Planning Items & Technical Dependencies
1. Lambda Function Understanding:

Currently reviewing the Lambda function shared by Bharat (which processes a CSV-based input).

No queue is directly visible in the code at this point.

Clarification needed:

Is there a queue integration planned post-CSV processing?

How will messages be routed downstream?

2. Messaging Architecture:

Still need to understand how the SOS queue or other message queues tie into the Lambda workflow.

Action Item: Connect with Bharat for architectural clarification regarding:

Expected message flow

Existing vs. new queue usage

3. DynamoDB Integration:

Current inserts/updates into DynamoDB have been commented out.

Need to finalize:

Table structure

Schema design

Once defined, a new DynamoDB instance will be created for testing.

4. File Testing Milestone (Today):

Goal: Complete E2E test with a single sample file by end of day today.

Will involve triggering the Lambda, validating output locations, and ensuring redaction/manual review flows.
